# FGM FHIR Code #
The code within this repository is exemplar code to demonstrate how the FHIR XML content within the FGM DMS can be created.

These example make use of he opensource C# FHIR API located here [https://github.com/ewoutkramer/fhir-net-api](https://github.com/ewoutkramer/fhir-net-api "fhir-net-ap")

The use of this API is for illustration purposes only, by using it the HSCIC makes no endorsement of the API. Implementers are free to use other APIs to create FHIR content or can develop it natively if desired.
